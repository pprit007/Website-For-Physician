While serving patients is his primary passion, he has developed a deep interest on how to improve healthcare for the American people so that it can be accessible and affordable for all citizens. Over the years, he has owned several clinics, employed a number of physicians and nursing staff, and has experienced over 500,000 medical visits. Through processing medical claims for all these services, all the corruption embedded in America’s current healthcare system has become obvious. It is his firm belief that the unnecessary regulations, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical lobbies have created huge barriers between a true patient-doctor relationship which are choking this noble spirit and increasing costs to U.S. healthcare. For the healthcare industry to be truly evolved to patient-centered care and to decrease existing fraud, waste, and overutilization, these barriers must be broken and control should be transferred to the patient. It is up to the Genius Patient to learn about the current crisis and rise up to take back control of his or her healthcare.</div></td>

It is the people who innovate and find ways to give maximum satisfaction. That is the wonder of free market economy. Our healthcare institutions and the quality of care they deliver are unmatched anywhere else. It is a fact that our doctors and nurses are the best and most competent and caring group of medical professionals in the world. The problems we face in healthcare today have nothing to do with the expertise and knowledge of our doctors or the compassion of our nursing care since these aspects of our healthcare system are doing exceptionally well. Yet, many Americans continue to face increasing healthcare costs, decreasing face-to-face time with their doctors, unmet healthcare needs, unaffordable medications, and so on.</div></td>
