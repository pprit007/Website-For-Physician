                Based on data available average healthcare cost per capita  in USA is approximately $8000, which is almost twice as high as compare to  other developed nations. However average health care cost per Medicare patient  in USA is almost in the range of $12000 to $14000. For 40 Million Medicare  recipients, Government spent $400 Billion in 2008.In addition to this Medicare  patients out of pocket cost is in the range of $2000 to $4000 for the  supplemental insurance, part D premium and medications.
