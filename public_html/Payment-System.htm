The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very  rare condition, which causes your testicles to press up against the base of  your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache.

He couldn't concentrate  long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.  When he left the hospital, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing  an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he  felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new  life. He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, &quot;That's what I  need: a new suit.&quot; He entered the shop and told the salesman, &quot;I'd  like a new suit.&quot; The salesman eyed him briefly and said, &quot;Let's  see... size 44 long.&quot; Joe laughed, &quot;That's right, how did you  know?&quot; &quot;It's my job.&quot; Joe tried on the suit.
